# Binary-Image Classifier

To run the code, go the classifier folder. 
Inside the "src" folder is a MATLAB script called "script.m". 
Open it and run it.

run `scr/script.m`

The script creates different paths, trains the classifier, then tests it and prints the overall quality and the confusion matrix.
It then performs two extra test cases and prints the output to the command line.
